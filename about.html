        <h2>About JT's Auto and Truck</h2>
        <p>JT started out in Auto body collision repair as a young adult. Through the years he built and completed many custom restorations on vehicles.
        JT worked since a young adult in auto body collision repair and specialized in working with big trucks. During 2006 he began focusing to work
        part-time on more glass replacement and windshield repairs while continuing collision repair part-time.  JT found that running the glass
        business full-time is what he wanted to do and this is something he enjoyed very much, being able to satisfy the customers with a completed
        job in a shorter time and being there for customers when they needed him.  

        So in 2008, JT  decided to open the business full-time with glass installation and windshield repair. Since then, the business has grown
        and expanded its doors to surrounding counties and multiple types of vehicles.  Offering service for all vehicle makes and models, as well
        as Heavy Equipment, Private owners, Commercial, and Fleet.</p>
